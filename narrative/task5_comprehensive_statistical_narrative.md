## Reorganized Analysis Pipeline Overview

The analysis has been restructured into five sequential scripts for improved clarity and reproducibility:

1. **01_data_preparation.R**: Data reshaping and preparation utilities
2. **02_comprehensive_analysis.R**: Main analysis covering all 5 concrete tasks
3. **03_advanced_statistics.R**: Advanced statistical methods and estimation statistics
4. **04_refined_analyses.R**: Focused analyses on core categories
5. **05_publication_figures.R**: Publication-ready figure generation

This reorganization reduces redundancy from ~3,400 lines across 8 scripts to ~2,600 lines across 5 scripts while maintaining all functionality.

## Comprehensive Cross-Modal Insights (Updated)

### 1. Universal Kinematic Principles
The reorganized analysis confirms robust patterns that generalize across both signed (DGS, RSL) and spoken (German, Russian) languages:

- **Form-based patterns**: Duration differences between head nod forms
- **Function-based patterns**: Systematic kinematic differences between communicative functions
- **Turn-taking patterns**: Position-dependent kinematic characteristics
- **Independence principle**: Function and turn-taking effects operate independently

### 2. Duration as Master Variable
Across all five tasks, duration emerges as the primary kinematic differentiator:

- **Task 1**: Only significant form differentiator (p = 0.042)
- **Task 2**: Strongest function effects (F = 282.703, p < 2e-16)
- **Task 3**: Contains top 3 strongest effects in integrated analysis
- **Task 4**: Significant in comprehensive but not refined analysis
- **Task 5**: Best predictor in mixed-effects models

### 3. Hierarchical Effect Structure (Updated)
The reorganized analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of kinematic effects:

1. **Function effects** (strongest): Medium to small effects (d = 0.42-0.61)
2. **Form effects** (moderate): Small effects, duration-specific (η² = 0.0035)
3. **Turn-taking effects** (context-dependent): Variable by analysis scope
4. **Interaction effects** (weakest): Negligible effects (η² < 0.0001)

### 4. Cross-Modal Validation (Confirmed)
All major findings replicate across language modalities:
- **Signed languages** (DGS, RSL): Consistent with spoken language patterns
- **Spoken languages** (German, Russian): Consistent with signed language patterns
- **Universal mechanisms**: Support embodied communication theories
